## 📘 Course Description

**Introduction to AI Programming** is a foundational laboratory course that introduces students to essential programming concepts and data manipulation techniques using Python.  
The course emphasizes **hands‑on practice with real coding tasks**, helping learners develop clear and efficient code using Python’s built‑in features such as list and dictionary comprehensions.

Through weekly lab exercises, students will:
- Build confidence in Python programming fundamentals.
- Learn how to process and transform data using concise and readable code.
- Apply comprehension techniques for lists and dictionaries.
- Solve practical problems involving data filtering, mapping, and transformation.
- Prepare for more advanced topics in AI, data science, and software development.

By the end of the course, students should be able to write concise, Pythonic code that can efficiently handle and manipulate classroom datasets for common data‑processing workflows.
